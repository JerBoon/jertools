So, I was learning how to build packages, and to help me, I came across this useful function
lsp() at https://www.r-bloggers.com/exploring-the-functions-in-a-package/

For one reason or another (basically a recognised bug) I kept having to restart R, and each time
kept having to go and google for that URL again...

Seemed an obvious case for maintain a personal library of useful stuff

Especially now I'm using R on multiple machines.

You get the idea...

You're more that welcome to take a copy f you want, nbut liek I said, it's a
personal collection!
